# PyScheme

A Python implementation of the Scheme programming language, built as a learning project to master Python's standard library and Test-Driven Development (TDD).

## Goals

- **Short-term**: Implement the BSL (Beginning Student Language) subset of Scheme
- **Medium-term**: Support  Revised^5 Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme otherwise known as R5RS (ambitious)
- **Long-term**: Target R7RS-small compliance (unlikely)

## Learning Focus

This project serves as a deep dive into:
- Python standard library mastery
- Test-Driven Development practices
- Language implementation concepts
- Functional programming principles

## Current Status

ðŸš§ **Work in Progress** - Currently implementing the tokenizer using TDD

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Run tests
uv run pytest

# Run the interpreter (when implemented)
uv run pyscheme
```

## Project Structure

```
